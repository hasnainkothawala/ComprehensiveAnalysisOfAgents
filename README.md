# ComprehensiveAnalysisOfAgents

## This projects was an endevour to test and improve my Python Programming skills.

## This project covers following areas:
1. Creates and Simulates a Taxi Based Agent Environment (Multiple Versions).
2. The agent can be initialized and be run in the environment to see its behaviour (Intresting Visuals).
3. Simulates the agent to use multiple search techiniques to find customers such as :
    ### UnInformed Search Techniques:
      1. Breadth First Search.
      2. Depth First Search.
      3. Iterative Deepening.
      4. Depth Limited Search.
      
      
    ### Informed Search Techniques:
      1. Uniform Cost Search.
      2. A* Search
      3. Recursive Best First Search.


4. Performs a detailed time and memony comparision of all the combinations.
